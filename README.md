# Word flower

### Try it, compiled for web!

Click [here](https://dylandhall.github.io/wordflower_web/) to play the game. It's actually super fun.

A new Flutter project. I'm just testing the framework out, this is a small game for my partner, based off an old puzzle book she had. I've added scoring to make it more fun.

Note, I understand Hive is superseded but I have very basic requirements - if you're using this as an example however, I'd use [Isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar) instead.

In the `asset_generation` folder you'll find the word databases I used to produce my lists and links to the sources.
